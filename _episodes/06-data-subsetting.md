Much of R's power comes from its vectorization. R has many powerful subset operators and mastering them will allow you to
easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset without the resource depletion of loops.

There are a few different ways we can subset any kind of object, and
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with a data structure we've seen before, the workhorse of R: atomic vectors.


~~~
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
~~~
{: .r}

We can name elements within our vectors using the `names` function. Here, we have named each element
with a different letter of the alphabet.

~~~
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
  a   b   c   d   e
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5
~~~
{: .output}

So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its
contents?

## Accessing elements using their indices

To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting
from one:


~~~
x[1]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a
5.4
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
x[4]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  d
4.8
~~~
{: .output}

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For atomic vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:


~~~
x[c(1, 3)]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   c
5.4 7.1
~~~
{: .output}

Or slices of the vector:


~~~
x[1:4]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   b   c   d
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8
~~~
{: .output}

Remember that the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right. Using it inside the square
brackets lets us select a range of elements.

We can ask for the same element multiple times:


~~~
x[c(1,1,3)]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   a   c
5.4 5.4 7.1
~~~
{: .output}

If we ask for a number outside of the vector, R will return missing values:


~~~
x[6]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
<NA>
  NA
~~~
{: .output}

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:


~~~
x[0]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
named numeric(0)
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Vector numbering in R starts at 1
>
> In many programming languages (C and python, for example), the first
> element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
{: .callout}

## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:


~~~
x[-2]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   c   d   e
5.4 7.1 4.8 7.5
~~~
{: .output}


We can skip multiple elements:


~~~
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  b   c   d
6.2 7.1 4.8
~~~
{: .output}

> ~~~

>
> ~~~
>   d   e
> 4.8 7.5
> ~~~
> {: .output}
{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the results back
into the variable:


~~~
x <- x[-4]
x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   b   c   e
5.4 6.2 7.1 7.5
~~~
{: .output}

## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of index:


~~~
x[c("a", "c")]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  a   c
5.4 7.1
~~~
{: .output}

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

Unfortunately we can't skip or remove elements so easily when we extract them by their name.

To skip (or remove) a single named element:


~~~
x[-which(names(x) == "a")]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  b   c   d   e
6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5
~~~
{: .output}

The `which` function returns the indices of all `TRUE` elements of its argument.
Remember that expressions evaluate before being passed to functions. Let's break
this down so that its clearer what's happening.

First this happens:


~~~
names(x) == "a"
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
~~~
{: .output}

The condition operator is applied to every name of the vector `x`. Only the
first name is "a" so that element is TRUE.

`which` then converts this to an index:


~~~
which(names(x) == "a")
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}



Only the first element is `TRUE`, so `which` returns 1. Now that we have indices
the skipping works because we have a negative index!

Skipping multiple named indices is similar, but uses a different comparison
operator:


~~~
x[-which(names(x) %in% c("a", "c"))]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
  b   d   e
6.2 4.8 7.5
~~~
{: .output}

The `%in%` goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the
names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?".


> ## Tip: Getting help for operators
>
> Remember you can search for help on operators by wrapping them in quotes:
> `help("%in%")` or `?"%in%"`.
>
{: .callout}


So why can't we use `==` like before? That's an excellent question.

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:


~~~
names(x) == c('a', 'c')
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Warning in names(x) == c("a", "c"): longer object length is not a multiple
of shorter object length
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

Obviously "c" is in the names of `x`, so why didn't this work? `==` works
slightly differently than `%in%`. It will compare each element of its left argument
to the corresponding element of its right argument.

Here's a mock illustration:


~~~
c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")  # names of x
   |    |    |    |    |    # The elements == is comparing
c("a", "c")
~~~
{: .r}

Remember from our last lesson, when one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:


~~~
c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")  # names of x
   |    |    |    |    |    # The elements == is comparing
c("a", "c", "a", "c", "a")
~~~
{: .r}

In this case R simply repeats `c("a", "c")` two and a half times. If the longer
vector length isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length, then
R will also print out a warning message.

This difference between `==` and `%in%` is important to remember,
because it can introduce hard to find and subtle bugs!

## Using Logical Operations to Subset Data

We can subset data by using boolean vectors:

~~~
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
a a
1 2
~~~
{: .output}


R will return any values that are indicated by `TRUE` in your vector, and filter out any that
are `FALSE`.


~~~
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
a a
1 3
~~~
{: .output}

Notice how R also recycled our logical vector to the correct length?


Since comparison operators evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors. When we do a logical comparison on a vector, R returns a
logical vector as the result:

~~~
x > 7
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
    a     b     c     d     e
FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

We can nest our comparison inside of our subsetting operators to tell R to return a subset of
our data which matches whatever criteria we specify.

~~~
x[x > 7]
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
  c   e
7.1 7.5
~~~
{: .output}



> ## Tip: Combining logical conditions
>
> There are many situations in which you will wish to combine multiple logical
> criteria. For example, we might want to find all the countries that are
> located in Asia **or** Europe **and** have life expectancies within a certain
> range. Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:
>
>  * `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right
>    are `TRUE`.
>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right
>    (or both) are `TRUE`.
>
> The recycling rule applies with both of these, so `TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`
> will compare the first `TRUE` on the left of the `&` sign with each of the
> three conditions on the right.
>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These operators
> do not use the recycling rule: they only look at the first element of each
> vector and ignore the remaining elements. The longer operators are mainly used
> in programming, rather than data analysis.
>
>  * `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
>    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes
>    `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes
>    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).
>
> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the
> `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)
> and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the
> vector are `TRUE`).
