Note that the Makefile doesn't use _episodes_rmd at all. Jekyll builds the
HTML from _episodes, which contains only .md files. Which .md files are
transformed into HTML is controlled by _config.yml. (To understand this
process better, I'd have to read the Jekyll/Github Pages documentation.) But
it appears that I could add more .md file (e.g. in _extras) or even add a new
directory of .md files.

Instead of 'make site' use 'jekyll build --watch --incremental'. That way each
time you modify and save a file, the changed files are regenerated! (Of
course, you need to refresh the browser).
